## USGS Collection Metadata Mockup

The experiment is meant to demonstrate how the USGS observations data catalog might be formatted as collections metadata. 

In particular, how to handle parameter codes and statistic codes is an open question.

`sourcer.R` contains a few locally defined functions. 
`build_collection_metadata.R` generates `mockup.json`
